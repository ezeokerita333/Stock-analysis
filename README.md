## Overview
    The purpose of this project is analyse the total stock volume and the returns on each stocks for the year 2017 and 2018 using primarily Visual Basic for Applications(VBA).

## Results
    The All stock analysis worksheet showing both the 2017 and 2018 stocks simply just describe the total volumes and its returns for the total of 12 stocks. Based on the 2017 return values, which shows 'DQ' had the highest return value and 'TERP' had the lowest return rates while in 2018 return values show RUN' to bring the higest return values and 'VSLR' had the lowest return values, Thus, showing the stocks in both years doesnt follow a any particular pattern. 
I would advise Steve to consider Inputing more years in order to make a specific decision on its returns and also consider refactoring code, which makes it a bit more faster and efficient.

## Summary
   One of the advantage of refactory my code when doing my analysis was that it definitely made my work run much faster and was easier to read, thus, making it easier to find where there is an error and correct my code. While the disadvantages of refactoring my code was that I noticed it became a bit more complex and very easy to make mistakes.
